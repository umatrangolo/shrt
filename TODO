v REST routes:
1. API for adding a shortened URL:
   > PUT /shrts
   > body: { url: [url to shrt], proposal: [proposed token]* }
   < 201 OK { url: [url to shrt], shrt: [shrtned url] }
   < 403 KO { url: [url to shrt] } // proposed token (if any) is already taken

2. API to get a shortened URL:
   > GET /shrts/<token>
   < 301 to [original url]
   < 404 // if no url for given token

3. API for deleting a shrt url
   > DELETE /shrts/<token>
   < 200 OK
   < 404 // if no url for given token

4. API for listing all the shrt urls
   > GET /shrts
   < 200 OK
   < body: { ... all urls json encoded ...}

v Store them in H2
v Count each time a token/url is used

- Use Lucene to index shrts
- AngularJS based UI
- Better analytics
- Performance ??
